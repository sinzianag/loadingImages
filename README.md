# loadingImages
What is the best way to load images in an Android app so that the experience looks as good as possible.

I'm building an application to test different ways of loading images in an android application.
Basically trying to make the experience of opening an application and viewing images as smooth as possible. 
I want to answer a few questions around what makes a good experience and here are a few of the use cases I want to test out:
* loading full resolution images and downsampling ( this is probably the worst scenario and I will be my control)
* loading images that are the size that I need or very close
* loading images that are smaller and upsampling + where the limit is to finding images that look good.
* loading images in two stages - low res then replacing them with normal res.
